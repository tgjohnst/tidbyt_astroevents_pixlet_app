# Data Parsing
For development of the app, we need to supply readable data. 
- We pull the starting data from [RapidApi::Astronomy_Calendar](https://rapidapi.com/sharmadhirajnp2/api/astronomy-calendar/)
- We parse the less formal dates into a more standardized form
  - We add start and end time for each event
